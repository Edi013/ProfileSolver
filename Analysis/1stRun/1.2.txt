1. 1807 entries in table urls, deci 1807 site-uri procesate.
    Desi numarul de site-uri este 1807, scraper ul a gasit (sau crede ca a gasit) 1000 de companii.
    Atasez ss pentru cele mentionate anterior.


2. Fill rates :
- 374 phone numbers
- 918 locations
- 1163 addresses
All for 1807 urls parsed and 1000 companies reached.

After first run, I started optimizing it by looking at:
- the tags considered for each address, location, title
- the quantity of calls againt the db : refactored single inserts into bulk inserts.
- the keywords for address, locations
- the regex for phone number
- the find title method.

Runs count:
1. 1000c 35m,    0.035 min/company (~2.1 sec/company)
2. 388c  11:45m, 0.0303 min/company (~1.8 sec/company)
